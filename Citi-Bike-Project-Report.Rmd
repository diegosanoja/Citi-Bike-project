# Objective of the Project

The objective was to analyze the customer data of Citi Bike, the nation's
largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600 stations across Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City with the purpose of understanding how and
which type of clients use the bikes of the company to provide recommendations
of how to turn customers (users with a 24-hour pass or a 7-day pass) to
subscribers (users with an annual membership).

# Data Used

For this project the data used was the one stored in the Google Public data set
called NYC Citi Bike Trips. The data was processed by Citi Bike to remove rents
that are taken by staff to service and inspect the system, as well as any rents
below 60 seconds in length, which are considered false starts.

Each row of the set consists of a moment where a bike was rented. Each
observation contains information like the length of the trip in seconds, the
time when it was rented from and returned to a station as well as the names of
the stations, the type of rider, and gender of the person who used the bike.

The data has some limitations: it provides information starting from 2013 where
the bike sharing program started, some of the clients don't reveal their gender
or year of birth, there is no customer id, there is no information regarding
the prices to rent the bikes for each type of customer nor season discounts
from the last years, therefore, it is assumed that they were similar to the ones
in the present.

# Analysis Summary

For the analysis phase a total of 8 csv files generated using Big Query were
used. The data set from which the files were generated contains 33319019
observations which happened between July 2013 and September of 2016.

The first file analyzed was the Rents_per_rider_type_and_gender csv file. It
contains the amount of bikes rented per day, month and year the rents occurred
as well as the gender and user type of the riders. From this file, 5 visuals
and 1 table were created, each one provided different insights regarding the
people who used bikes.

```{r Figure 1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure1.png')
```
The first of those visuals is Figure 1 displayed above which shows the
percentage of rents made each year. The purpose of this pie chart was to
understand how the leases had changed from the beginning of the program until
the end of the period that the data set covers. This chart provided the
following insights:

1. Every year, there was more people that used bikes from Citi bike.

2. The greatest increase was from 2013 to 2014. A possible reason for this
could be that the program started during the later half of 2013.

3. The lowest increase was from 2015 to 2016. A possible reason for this could
be that the data set contains information of the first 3 quarters of 2016.

The next step analyzing this file was to know how many bikes were used by
customers and subscribers through the years. To answer question, Figure 2 was
built which shows the number of bikes rented each year for each group of riders.

```{r Figure 2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure2.png')
```

By examining Figure 2 closely, the following conclusions were reached:

1. Subscribers used more bikes than customers each year with 2016 being the year
that the difference was greater.

2. For subscribers, there was an increase in the amount of rents each year
while for customers there was not a specified trend of increase nor decrease as
time passed.

3. Approximately, 88% of the rents were done by subscribers.

4. Subscribers used more than 4 million bikes each year while customer rented
between 0.5 and 1.5 million bikes each year.

To continue with the process it was important to know the gender of the riders
and how much each one used a bike. To achieve the objective, Figure 3 was
designed to show the number of bikes rented each year by the gender of the
riders.

```{r Figure 3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure3.png')
```

After studying Figure 3 closely, the following conclusions were reached:

1. Males were the ones who rented bikes the most.

2. During each year, the combination of rents of both female riders and the ones
who kept their gender private composed less than 50% of the riders through each
year.

3. For each group, the number of rents increased every year (except for the
unknowns group in 2016).

Furthermore it was important to understand which gender used more bikes in each
group. To discover that, Table 1 shown below was created and it separates the
number of rents both by the gender and user type of the client.

```{r Table 1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Table1.png')
```

Table 1 provided the following insights regarding the riders:

1. Most of the members of the customer group didn't provide their gender when
they payed to use the bikes.

2. Most subscribers were males.

3. For both groups (mainly for the subscriber group), men used more bikes than
women.

In addition to knowing how many riders fell in each group of gender and user
type, it was of great interest discovering which day of the week a rider rented
a bike. To discover that, Figure 4 was built to display the number of rents per
group for each day of the week starting from Monday.

```{r Figure 4, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure4.png')
```

By examining Figure 4 closely, the following conclusions were reached:

1. Subscribers rented bikes mainly from Monday to Friday while the customers
rented them mostly during weekends.

2. The day where bikes were rented mainly by subscribers and customers were
Wednesdays and Saturdays respectively.

To conclude the analysis on this particular file, the month and year where the
bikes were rented were combined to create time periods with the objective of
determining if there were patterns or trends in the data set. To achieve this
goal, Figure 5 was created which shows the number of bikes rented each month of
each year per user type.

```{r Figure 5, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure5.png')
```

After studying Figure 5 closely, the following insights were discovered:

1. Every month of every year, subscribers used more bikes than customers.

2. For each group of clients there was a seasonality trend (mainly for the
subscribers group) since the number of rents was at its maximum during the
months of summer and at the lowest during the months of winter each year.

3. For almost every time period, subscribers and customers rented more than 200
thousand bikes and less than 200 thousand bikes respectively.

The Average_lease_time_per_user_type file was the second document analyzed, it
contains the average time that a bike was used each year per user type. Using
this data, Figure 6 was designed which displays the average lease time of each
rider type per year.

```{r Figure 6, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure6.png')
```

By examining Figure 6 carefully, the following conclusions were obtained:

1. The average lease time was higher for customers than for subscribers.

2. Each year, the average lease time increased for customers with the greatest
increase being from 2014 to 2015.

3. The average lease time for subscribers had no defined trend of increase nor
decrease and was always between 10 and 15 minutes.

The third csv file analyzed was the Average_lease_time_per_gender document
which contains the average time that a bike was rented each year per gender of
the client. Using this data, Figure 7 was designed which shows the average
lease time of each rider by gender per year.

```{r Figure 7, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure7.png')
```

The examination of Figure 7 provided the following insights:

1. Every year, riders of unknown gender made leases that lasted longer, while
the ones that did shorter leases were males.

2. The average lease time of the clients who made longer leases increased every
year. The average for this group is between 25 and 35 minutes through the time
period of interest.

3. The average lease times for males and females had no defined trend of
increase or decrease and were always between 12 and 14 minutes for males and
between 14 and 16 minutes for females.

4. The difference between the average for males and females was within a range
of 2 to 3 in minutes.

To discover the time that a bike was rented the most each year both by user
type and gender of the client, the Longest_rent_time_per_user_type_and_gender
was created and studied. Using the data of this file, 3 visuals were created.
The first one was Figure 8 which displays the time of the longest rent per
user type each year.

```{r Figure 8, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure8.png')
```

After studying Figure 8 closely, the following conclusions were reached:

1. In 2013 and 2016, a customer was the rider who rented the bike for the
longest time while in 2014 and 2015 the opposite happened.

2. There wasn't a trend of increase nor decrease for the time of the longest
rent each year for each group.

3. The year with the greatest difference in the longest rents between groups
was 2013.

To further analyze the data in the file, Figures 9 and 10 were designed which
display the longest ride time but by gender each one by a group of riders in
particular.

```{r Figure 9, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure9.png')
```

The data used to create Figure 9 provided the following insights:

1. Customers of unknown gender made the longest rent each year.

2. For customers that were either female or males, their longest bike rent each
year was close.

3. The year where a customer rented a bike the longest was in 2016.

```{r Figure 10, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure10.png')
```

The data used to create Figure 10 provided the following insights:

1. Through most of the time period of interest, (except in 2016), subscribers
of unknown gender had the shortest rent in this group of clients. However, the
time of the longest rent made by this group increased every year.

2. Male subscribers rented a bike the longest in 2014 and 2016 while females
did this in 2013 and 2015.

3. The longest rent made by a subscriber was in 2015.

Since most of the longest rents shown in Figures 8 to 10 are above 200 hundred
hours each year, the insights and conclusions from Figures 6 and 7 could be
skewed by those values and others close to them. To discover if the results
were skewed, the leases were divided in 2 categories, short and long. Shorts
leases are the ones were the a bike was used by a client for an hour at most
while long leases are the ones that lasted more than 1 hour.

To confirm if the results were skewed or not, 4 csv files were generated, the
first one of them that was analyzed was the Long_rents_per_user_type_and_gender
file. It contains the amount of bikes rented per day, month and year the rents
occurred as well as the gender and user type of the riders. Using the data of
this file, the table and line chart shown below were designed.

Table 2 separates the number of leases both by the gender and user type of the
client in the columns and the year by row. Figure 11 is a line chart which
displays the number of long rents each month of each year per user type and
gender.

```{r Table 2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Table2.png')
```

```{r Figure 11, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure11.png')
```

After studying both Table 2 and Figure 11 closely, the following conclusions
were obtained:

1. The greatest number of long rents was done by customers.

2. The year that had the greatest number of long leases was 2015.

3. Customers of unknown gender were the ones who made more long rents through
each year while for the group of subscribers, males were the ones that did long
rents mostly each year.

4. For each year, the customer group had a greater number of long leases than
the subscriber group during the months of summer, especially in 2015.

5. There was a seasonal trend of increase for both groups with the greatest and
lowest amounts of long leases during the months summer and winter respectively.

6. During the months of winter in 2013 and 2014, subscribers made more long
leases than customers. The opposite happened in 2015.

Furthermore, after adding the numbers of each category in the table, it was
discovered that 373368 rents were longer than an hour which is equivalent to
1.12% of the observations in the data set. Therefore, 98.88% of the leases were
short. The next step of the analysis was to discover how this affected the rent
averages.

By using the data in the Trips_per_customer_gender_and_type file and Table 2,
Table 3 shown below was designed. It has the same structure as Table 2 but it
displays the number of short leases instead.

```{r Table 3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Table3.png')
```

Table 3 provided the following insights regarding riders who made short rents:

1. Each year for the customer group, most of the rents were done by riders who
refused to reveal their gender.

2. With the exception of 2015, the number of female and male customers
increased every year.

3. Only customers who refused to provide their gender used bikes in 2015.

4. Each year for the subscriber group, the number of leases increased, 
especially for males.

The next file analyzed was the Short_rents_average_time_per_user_type csv,
which contains the average of the short rents per year and user type of the
clients. Figure 12 shown below displays the data in the file.

```{r Figure 12, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure12.png')
```

By examining Figure 12 and comparing it to Figure 6, the following insights
were obtained:

1. The average of each group was reduced each year, especially for the customer
group.

2. The average rent time still was lower for subscribers than for customers but
the difference was lower than before.

3. The average lease time of subscribers was between 11 and 13 minutes each
year while for customers was between 19 and 22 minutes.

The Short_rents_average_time_per_gender was the second to last csv analyzed,
which contains the average of the short rents per year and gender of the
clients. Figure 13 shown below displays the data in the file.

```{r Figure 13, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure13.png')
```

By studying Figure 13 and comparing it to Figure 7, the following conclusions
were obtained:

1. The average of each group was reduced each year, especially for riders who
didn't provide their gender when renting a bike. Also, the increase in the
average each year was lower.

2. The average lease time still was lower for males than for females and there
was no trend in the average as the time passed. Furthermore, the average was
between 11 and 12 minutes for males and between 13 and 14 minutes for females.

3. The average rent time of riders of unknown gender now was between 19 and 22
minutes. Furthermore, the trend of increase in the average time each year still
remained.

The Short_rents_average_time_per_user_type_and_gender was the last csv file
analyzed, it contains the average time of the bike leases per year and both the
gender and user type of the client. By using the data of this document, Figures
14 and 15 were designed to show the longest lease time by gender, each one by a
group of riders in particular.

```{r Figure 14, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure14.png')
```

After studying Table 3 and Figures 12 to 14 closely, the following conclusions
were obtained:

1. The average of subscribers of unknown gender increased every year while the
averages of females and males had no trend.

2. Through most of the years except in 2016, female subscribers had a higher
average than the other 2 groups.

3. The average of female subscribers was always higher than the one of male
subscribers.

4. The average of each year for the customer group was mainly influenced by the
lease time of male riders.

```{r Figure 15, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/Diego/Documents/Citi Bike project/Figure15.png')
```

After analyzing Table 3, Figures 12, 13 and 15 carefully, the following
conclusions were obtained:

1. The average of customers of unknown sex was between 19 and 22 minutes and it
increased every year.

2. In 2013 and 2016, female customers had a higher average than male ones. The
opposite happened in 2014.

3. The average of 2015 was made only by customers of unknown gender.

4. The average of each year for the customer group was mainly influenced by
the lease time of riders of unknown gender.

# Conclusions

* Each year, the amount of bikes used by each group increased, especially for
male subscribers.

* About 98.88% of the clients rented bikes for periods shorter than or equal to 1
hour.

* The months where bikes were used the most are the ones of the summer season
(from June to September), where subscribers used more bikes than customers each
month of every year.

* Most customers didn't provide their gender when they rented bikes and they
used them mostly on weekends. Furthermore, customers were the clients who used
bikes for longer periods of time in average.

* Subscribers rented bikes mainly through the week. Also, male subscribers
rented bikes for lower periods of time than female subscribers in average.

# Recommendations to turn customers into subscribers.

a. Propose a discount or a special offer during the months of summer to turn
customers into subscribers.

b. Reduce the price of the annual membership for first-year subscribers.

c. Create a user name with a piece of information like the phone number or email
for each client when they use a bike. Then use this information to send the
users messages and updates that show them the benefits of becoming subscribers.

d. Collect further information about the clients like the user name or phone
number to discover how many times each rider uses a bike and what type of bike
they rent. Then, repeat this analysis after 1 year with the additional
information to make further examinations, reach stronger conclusions and
develop new and better ideas to increase the number of subscribers.
